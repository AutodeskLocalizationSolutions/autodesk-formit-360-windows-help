#### Moving Objects

1. **Double Click** to select an entire object (single click will select a face, edge or vertex, which is explained in [Modifying Faces, Edges, and Points](FormIt Introduction/Modifying Faces Edges and Points.md).)

2. Hover over the object to select the point you will use as the **snap point.** ![](./images/moving-object.png)

3. **Click and then start dragging**. You are now moving the object and the preselected point will now be your snap point.

4. Press the **tab key.** You can now type in a specific distance to move that object along the current axis.

5. **Right click** on the cube. You will see the **Context Menu**. ![](./images/77a49149-cc7d-4e90-97eb-576c27cef7f4.png)
