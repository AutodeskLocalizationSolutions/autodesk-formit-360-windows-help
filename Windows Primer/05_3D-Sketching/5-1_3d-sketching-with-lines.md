### 3D Sketching with lines

We are going to first Group the image plane. This will prevent sketched
lines from "sticking" to it. Select the plane by double-clicking it,
right-click and choose Group (G)

Click the Pencil to open the Sketching Toolbar

Choose the Line tool (L)

You can immediately start to sketch using straight lines segments

The red, green and blue axes display to allow you to sketch in 3D
without leaving the tool

The purple axis displays an axis relative to the lines you are currently
drawing

Hold down the Shift key while dragging a line segment to lock to the
current axis

Start with creating a rectangle on the ground plane

Click Settings &gt; turn off Snap to Grid (S G)

With the Line tool, click on one corner of the imported sketch. Drag
along to define one edge of the upper terrace

Use the Tab key to input exact dimensions. Make the long side **77'-4
1/8"** and the short side **28'-8** "

Press Esc. You are back in Select mode. You can now select the top face
and immediately pull the volume up **12'2"**

**Note** : *the red and green axes keep you at 90 degrees. When you draw
at an angle to the grid, a purple guide will allow you to stay 90
degrees relative to your current line.*
